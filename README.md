<b>Let's explore Mr. Tarique!</b>

- Hi, I’m Tarique Hasan (@slbfahad), working as a web developer. Besides that, I have a sharp knowledge and expertise in UI/UX design which made me more confident in my work process.
- I’m interested in exploring new ideas and love to implement them.
- From my college life, I was loving to code. Since I was studying Computer Science for 4 years, it has made me a passionate programmer along with UX Architect. Till now I've gathered strong knowledge about C, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS,  MySQL, React, Node JS, Website/Mobile App UI/UX, etc. along with a few software, programs, and databases.
- Currently, I'm working at various companies with great expertise in UI/UX and development. Specially I always try to ensure the modern look and feel in design and smart development.
